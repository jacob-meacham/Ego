Requires the newest version of DirectX 9 to run.  If you see an error about missing d3dx9_35.dll, you need
to update your DirectX.

Simply extract all of the files into a folder with the structure intact.  Then, click on Ego.exe and enjoy!

Below may contain spoilers!




Known bugs for this release:
- Sometimes when walking around the loose floorboard, Ego's animation flips out.
- Some of the animation directions are not correct for Ego facing an object.
- Sometimes, when taking an object from inventory, Ego will act as though you just used the object on itself.
- When you have opened the door, to exit, you must click on the exit, wait until Ego
  has stopped moving, and click again.  This is because of how the collision map is defined.

If you find a bug, or the game's graphics are messed up on your computer, please send an email
to jmeacha3@uoregon.edu with the subject Ego Bug.
